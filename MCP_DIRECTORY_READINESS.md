# MCP Directory Readiness - Handover Document

**Project Status**: Bear Notes MCP server is technically complete and functional, but missing documentation/compliance requirements for Anthropic MCP Directory submission.

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-02  
**Context**: [Anthropic MCP Directory Policy](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11697096-anthropic-mcp-directory-policy)

## ✅ What's Complete

**Technical Foundation:**
- 5 fully implemented MCP tools with proper UX-focused metadata
- Production-ready DXT bundle (2.4MB with icon)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Native SQLite integration (no external dependencies)
- Clean TypeScript codebase with linting/formatting
- Icon properly integrated and displaying

**Compliance Met:**
- Safety & Security requirements ✅
- Core compatibility requirements ✅  
- Reliable performance and error handling ✅
- Token efficiency ✅
- Local-only operation (privacy-focused) ✅

### Privacy Policy Document  
**Status**: Not created
**What's needed**: Formal privacy policy document

**Key points to cover:**
- Local-only operation (no data transmission)
- Bear database read-only access explanation  
- No user data collection or analytics
- X-callback-url usage for Bear app interaction
- macOS-only operation requirements

**Suggested location**: `PRIVACY.md` in project root

### Comprehensive Documentation
**Status**: Basic README exists, needs expansion
**What's needed**: Complete documentation with troubleshooting

**Structure needed:**
- Installation guide (DXT bundle process)
- System requirements (macOS, Bear Notes app, Node.js ≥22.5.0)
- Setup verification steps
- All 5 tools documented with examples
- Common troubleshooting scenarios
- Bear Notes database location explanation
- X-callback-url debugging

**Files to create/update**: 
- Expand `README.md` 
- Consider `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

### Three Example Use Cases
**Status**: Not documented
**What's needed**: Three complete workflow examples

**Suggested use cases:**
1. **Research Workflow**: Search existing notes → Open specific note → Add research findings
2. **Meeting Notes**: Create new meeting note → Add agenda items → Update with action items  
3. **Content Organization**: Search by tags → Review multiple notes → Create summary note

**Each example should show:**
- Step-by-step tool usage
- Expected inputs/outputs
- Screenshots of Bear app integration
- Real-world context

**Suggested location**: `EXAMPLES.md` or expanded `README.md`

## Technical Context Notes

**Current Bundle Status:**
- Production bundle: `bear-notes-mcp.dxt` (2.4MB)
- All tools working with improved UX metadata
- Icon displaying correctly in Claude Desktop
- Bundle includes production dependencies only

**Architecture Decisions Made:**
- Native Node.js SQLite (no external databases)
- X-callback-url for Bear integration (platform-specific but reliable)
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Utility functions for DRY compliance (createToolResponse, handleAddText)
- Temporary directory approach for clean bundle creation

**Development Workflow:**
- `task pack` - Creates production bundle
- `task dev` - Development server
- All quality checks integrated in build process

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Immediate** (30 min): Add tool annotations to `src/main.ts`
2. **Short-term** (1 hour): Create `PRIVACY.md` 
3. **Medium-term** (2-3 hours): Comprehensive documentation
4. **Complete** (1 hour): Document three use cases with examples

**Estimated total time to directory-ready**: 4-5 hours

## Files Referenced in This Session

- `src/main.ts` - Tool registrations (need annotations)
- `manifest.json` - Already compliant with proper tool descriptions  
- `Taskfile.yml` - Production bundle workflow
- `assets/icon.png` - Icon properly integrated
- Node SDK types at `node_modules/@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/esm/types.d.ts:15288` - ToolAnnotationsSchema reference

## Directory Submission Checklist

When ready to submit:
- [ ] Tool annotations implemented and tested
- [ ] Privacy policy created and reviewed
- [ ] Documentation complete with troubleshooting
- [ ] Three use cases documented with examples
- [ ] Final bundle testing in clean environment
- [ ] Review Anthropic MCP Directory Terms
- [ ] Submit with all required documentation
