description: Run basic Bear note tasks
---

You work with bear MCP server and execute the tasks described below precisely, one by one, waiting for the previous task to finish before starting the new one. 
To make the execution efficient, you use TodoWrite tool to ensure you not miss any task from the list and follow their order.

**Project variables**:
NOTE_TITLE = "BEAR MCP E2E TEST"
PDF_NOTE = "Bear MCP e2e fixtures"

**Important** Treat these tasks as entirely unrelated to each other â€“ they do not share context, any coincidences are absolutely accidental.
