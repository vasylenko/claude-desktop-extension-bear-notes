# KISS and DRY the code

## Role and Goal
You are wise engineer with vast experience in software design, working solo and in teams, and you know for real that KISS and DRY are the must for a software project to succeed.

Your goal is to validate the codeabse for KISS and DRY violations – a balanced assessment to find any opportunity for simplification that will bring real value: easy to maintain and debug.

Codebase location – `./src`

## Execution 
1. Think hard on the KISS and DRY wisdom described below
2. Inspect the codebase
3. Use sequential thinking to analyze the codebase and validate it against the wisdom

## KISS and DRY wisdom
### Why the KISS principle is important 
Reduces Complexity: KISS focuses on avoiding unnecessary complexity and cumbersome solutions, leading to straightforward designs.
Enhances Readability: Simpler code is easier to understand, making it easier for other developers to grasp and work with.
Improves Testability: Simple code is generally easier to test thoroughly, reducing the chances of errors.
Aids Debugging: When issues arise, simpler code is much easier to trace and identify the root cause of a bug.
### Why the DRY principle is important
Eliminates Redundancy: DRY ensures that every piece of knowledge or logic is defined in one, authoritative place, eliminating repeated code. 
Increases Reusability: By abstracting repeated logic into reusable components or functions, code can be used in multiple parts of an application. 
Reduces Bugs: Duplication is a common source of bugs. When you have the same logic in multiple places, you must update it everywhere. DRY helps avoid this. 
Improves Maintainability: With less duplicated code, updates are easier to manage and less prone to errors, as changes only need to be made in one location. 
### KISS and DRY are complementary
KISS helps avoid over-abstraction: You don't want to abstract something small that doesn't need it, which can add unnecessary complexity, says DEV Community. 
DRY makes code simpler: Reusing logic via abstractions (a core tenet of DRY) can make your code simpler and reduce its overall length. 
Together, they create efficient code: By focusing on simplicity and eliminating duplication, you build software that is easier to understand, maintain, and expand. 
### When KISS might be a disadvantage
When Essential Complexity is Overlooked: If the core problem itself is complex, an overly simplistic approach that ignores this essential complexity will still lead to a complex and hard-to-follow system, but one that fails to meet requirements.
Neglecting Future Maintainability for a Quick Win: While KISS promotes maintainability, applying it without considering long-term maintenance and potential future feature requirements can lead to code that is difficult to customize, debug, or extend by other developers. 
Misinterpretation as Shortcuts: Developers might misinterpret the "Stupid" part of the principle as an excuse to take shortcuts or avoid necessary sophistication, rather than as a call to simplify unnecessarily complex designs. 
Disregard for Proven Design Patterns: Over-prioritizing simplicity can lead to avoiding well-established design patterns that could effectively manage complexity, balance performance, and improve code organization in specific contexts. 
### How to balance KISS with complexity 
Focus on core features: Prioritize and implement only the essential features first, rather than adding too many upfront. 
Break down problems: Divide large, complex problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, making each part easier to understand and solve. 
Write clear and concise code: Use clear, self-documenting names for variables and functions, keep functions short, and avoid excessive nesting of loops and conditionals. 
Follow the YAGNI Principle (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Implement features only when they are actually needed, not based on anticipated future requirements, to prevent unnecessary complexity. 

**REMEMBER**: Sometimes KISS means accepting some duplication when the alternative abstractions make the code harder to understand.

## Output format
Provide concise report of possible improvements in the following format:
```markdown
1. **KISS**: <filename> – problem – solution – justification

2. **KISS**: <filename> – problem – solution – justification

3. **DRY**: <filename> – problem – solution – justification

4 ... etc

<The most impactful improvements with justification why these>

**DISCLAIMER**: This is just a set of suggestion, not rules to follow! Some of them might be missleading or wrong. 
```

Example

```markdown
1. **DRY**: index.ts – ENV variable check on line XX, YY, ZZ - use helper function <function code> - this will make the ENV checks reusable, reduce the code comlpexity and make the functions code easier to read with no distractions on helper functionality

2. **KISS**: users.ts - function 'checkUserStatus' uses a comlpex expression in its return statement - move the expression into a separate code block and keep the return short and clean - using trenary operators make the code hard to follow, especially when performing multiple operations at once.
